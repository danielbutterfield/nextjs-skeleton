# nextjs-skeleton

This is a very simple skeleton for starting to build a Next.js app. I started using Next.js early 2021 and I love it.
It's got plenty out of the box but at the beginning of every mini-project I'd repeat the same first few steps.
This aims to reduce that first initial repetitiveness.

## How to run it?

Well I left the Next.js README in the `/app` which has some useful information but the simple answer is: `cd /app` and `npm run dev`.

## What does the skeleton have?

- It uses SASS right out the box, see `/app/styles`
- It has several components already made, see `/app/components`
- It has a navigation menu, see `/app/pages/index.js` and `/app/routing.js`
- It has a custom 404 for incorrect paths, see `/app/pages/404.js`

## Ok, what's next?

I'll keep adding things as I need them, but this covers the "basics".
